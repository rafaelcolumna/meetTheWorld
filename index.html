            <br>
         <p id="london" style="display: none;">London is a world unto itself. The eclectic neighborhoods, <br>
             which house a blend of historical landmarks and modern-day<br>           
                attractions, can keep you occupied for days. If it's your<br>
               first time in London, save time for a visit to the Tower <br>
               of London, Tate Modern, Buckingham Palace or the British<br>
                Museum before sitting down to a classic afternoon tea. The <br>
                best time to travel to London is during the warmer months, <br>
                but be warned that this is also the busiest and most expensive <br>
                time of year.<br><br> </p>

        <p id="costa" style="display: none;">
            From volcanic mountains to verdant rainforests to stunning shorelines, <br>
            Costa Rica is a Central American gem. Explore the beaches along the <br>
             Nicoya Peninsula, hike along Arenal Volcano and spot exotic wildlife <br>
             in remote Tortuguero National Park. If you're looking for an adrenaline <br>
             rush, go swimming next to some of the country's waterfalls or zip lining<br>
              through its rainforests. Just make sure you plan a visit during <br>
              Costa Rica's dry season, or between mid-December and April.<br><br>

            <p id="phuket" style="display: none;">Located in southern Thailand, Phuket offers something for everyone, especially <br>
            budget-minded travelers. Everything from accommodations to spa treatments to <br>
            boat tours come with a low price tag. For stunning scenery, check out the <br>
            limestone cliffs of Phang Nga Bay and lounge on Phuket's gorgeous white sand<br>
             beaches. Other must-sees include Wat Chalong Temple and the Big Buddha. <br>
             Once the sun sets, take part in the island's lively nightlife scene.</p>

        <p id="rome" style="display: none;">
            When you visit the Eternal City, prepare to cross a few must-see <br>
            attractions – including the Colosseum, the Trevi Fountain and the <br>
            Pantheon – off of your bucket list. Additional treasures, such as <br>
             St. Peter's Basilica and the Sistine Chapel, can be found in nearby<br>
              Vatican City. Escape the tourist crowds by taking a twilight stroll <br>
              along the cobblestone streets of Trastevere, or head to Mercato <br>
              Centrale Roma to sample local delicacies like gelato and pizza.<br>
               Before leaving, peruse some of Rome's lesser-known museums, art <br>
               galleries and boutiques.

        <p id="rio" style="display: none;">
            Christ the Redeemer and the shores of Copacabana and Ipanema beaches<br> 
            are only some reasons why you should plan a trip to Rio. In the <br>
            Marvelous City, you can revel in the sounds of samba in the Lapa <br>
            neighborhood after strolling along the cobblestone streets of <br>
            Santa Teresa. Time your visit in February if you want to experience<br> 
            Carnival, though keep in mind that flights and hotels are expensive <br>
            when this world-famous celebration takes place.

            Simply setting foot in Japan's cosmopolitan capital is an experience <br>
            within itself. A city known for its bustling streets adorned with <br>
             flashing neon signs, Tokyo offers visitors a little bit of everything.<br>
              Foodies won't be let down by the city's fresh sushi and hearty ramen.<br>
               Budding photographers and adrenaline junkies will love taking in <br>
               the sweeping panoramas from the top of the Tokyo Skytree. <br>
               Shopaholics will find plenty of must-have designer products in Ginza.<br>
                And for history buffs, Tokyo offers centuries-old temples and <br>

            <p id="barcelona" style="display: none;">
                This Spanish city is a feast for the eyes: Visitors can walk <br>
                past medieval architecture in the Barri Gòtic, snap photos <br>
                of the intricate Sagrada Família and marvel at Gaudí's whimsical<br>
                creations in Park Güell. La Barceloneta Beach and the Parc de<br>
                la Ciutadella are perfect places to pass the time on a sunny <br>
                day before checking out the restaurants and bars along Las <br>
                Ramblas, which buzzes at all hours of the night. For travelers<br>
                who want to see Barcelona from above, a trek up Tibidabo is <br>
                a must.

        <p id="nyc" style="display: none;"> 
            New York City hosts infinite urban adventures: You can wander through <br>
            Central Park, tour the exhibits at the Met, catch a Broadway show or <br>
            peruse SoHo's stylish boutiques. At night, admire Manhattan's glittering <br>
            skyscrapers from the top of the Empire State Building or the rooftop bar<br>
             of your trendy boutique hotel. Foodies will also appreciate the Big <br>
             Apple's endless restaurant options. If you want to sample a bit of <br>
             everything, consider signing up for a food tour.

        <p id="bali" style="display: none;">
            Serene temples and beautiful beaches are the biggest draws to <br>
            this lush Indonesian paradise. And we do mean lush – the region's <br>
            notoriously soggy wet season is best avoided by planning a visit<br>
            between April and October. Break up your beach time with a visit<br>
            to Kintamani, home to a towering (and active) volcano and a <br>
            large lake. If you're craving an adrenaline rush, rent a scooter<br>
            and go exploring or hop on one of the island's many swings to soar<br>
            above rice terraces and jungles.
