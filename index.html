            London is a world unto itself. The eclectic neighborhoods, <br>
             which house a blend of historical landmarks and modern-day<br>           
                attractions, can keep you occupied for days. If it's your<br>
               first time in London, save time for a visit to the Tower <br>
               of London, Tate Modern, Buckingham Palace or the British<br>
                Museum before sitting down to a classic afternoon tea. The <br>
                best time to travel to London is during the warmer months, <br>
                but be warned that this is also the busiest and most expensive <br>
                time of year.<br><br>  <a href="https://weather.com/weather/tenday/l/ae8230efd4bc57fdf721a02c7eb2b88c56aa6e71d73666328e33af3ea2039032132e24ae91b6a07862c5091a9d95a4b8" target="_blank">More weather info.<br></a></p>

            From volcanic mountains to verdant rainforests to stunning <br>
            shorelines, Costa Rica is a Central American gem. Explore the <br> 
            beaches along the Nicoya Peninsula, hike along Arenal Volcano and <br>
            spot exotic wildlife in remote Tortuguero National Park. If <br>
            you're looking for an adrenaline rush, go swimming next to some of
            the country's waterfalls or zip lining through its rainforests.<br>
            Just make sure you plan a visit during Costa Rica's dry <br> 
              season, or between mid-December and April.<br><br>

            <p id="phuket" style="display: none;">Located in southern Thailand, Phuket offers something for everyone, <br> 
            especially budget-minded travelers. Everything from <br>
            accommodations to spa treatments to boat tours come with <br>
             a low price tag. For stunning scenery, check out the <br>
            limestone cliffs of Phang Nga Bay and lounge on Phuket's gorgeous <br>
            white sand beaches. Other must-sees include Wat Chalong Temple 
            and the Big Buddha. Once the sun sets, take part in the island's <br>
            lively nightlife scene.

            When you visit the Eternal City, prepare to cross a few must-see <br>
            attractions – including the Colosseum, the Trevi Fountain and the <br>
            Pantheon – off of your bucket list. Additional treasures, such as <br>
             St. Peter's Basilica and the Sistine Chapel, can be found in nearby<br>
              Vatican City. Escape the tourist crowds by taking a twilight stroll <br>
              along the cobblestone streets of Trastevere, or head to Mercato <br>
              Centrale Roma to sample local delicacies like gelato and pizza.<br>
               Before leaving, peruse some of Rome's lesser-known museums, art <br>
               galleries and boutiques.<br> <br>

            Christ the Redeemer and the shores of Copacabana and Ipanema beaches<br> 
            are only some reasons why you should plan a trip to Rio. In the <br>
            Marvelous City, you can revel in the sounds of samba in the Lapa <br>
            neighborhood after strolling along the cobblestone streets of <br>
            Santa Teresa. Time your visit in February if you want to experience<br> 
            Carnival, though keep in mind that flights and hotels are expensive <br>
            when this world-famous celebration takes place. <br> <br>

                This Spanish city is a feast for the eyes: Visitors can walk <br>
                past medieval architecture in the Barri Gòtic, snap photos <br>
                of the intricate Sagrada Família and marvel at Gaudí's whimsical<br>
                creations in Park Güell. La Barceloneta Beach and the Parc de<br>
                la Ciutadella are perfect places to pass the time on a sunny <br>
                day before checking out the restaurants and bars along Las <br>
                Ramblas, which buzzes at all hours of the night. For travelers<br>
                who want to see Barcelona from above, a trek up Tibidabo is <br>
                a must.<br> <br>

            New York City hosts infinite urban adventures: You can wander<br>
            through Central Park, tour the exhibits at the Met, catch a <br>
            Broadway show or peruse SoHo's stylish boutiques. At night, <br>
            admire Manhattan's glittering skyscrapers from the top of the <br>
            Empire State Building or the rooftop bar of your trendy <br>
            boutique hotel. Foodies will also appreciate the Big Apple's <br>
            endless restaurant options. If you want to sample a bit of <br>

            Serene temples and beautiful beaches are the biggest draws to <br>
            this lush Indonesian paradise. And we do mean lush – the region's <br>
            notoriously soggy wet season is best avoided by planning a visit<br>
            between April and October. Break up your beach time with a visit<br>
            to Kintamani, home to a towering (and active) volcano and a <br>
            large lake. If you're craving an adrenaline rush, rent a scooter<br>
            and go exploring or hop on one of the island's many swings to soar<br>
            above rice terraces and jungles.<br> <br>
